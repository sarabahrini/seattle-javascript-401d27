![CF](http://i.imgur.com/7v5ASc8.png) DESIGN - SASS Setup
=========================================================

## Assignment
For this warm-up, we'll be creating a new repo where we'll be storing our design as we build it throughout the course.

During your build-outs of React components, you'll be pulling from and adding to this repo, moving things around, and generally setting up your personal design workflow.

### Requirements
* Create a new repository called "sass-design" in your github account
* Create the beginnings of your design by scaffolding out the core system using a `$rootColor` variable and nested declarations
  * design.scss

### Submission Instructions
Report in canvas with a link to the PR for this branch.  You may merge it to master after your submission is turned in.
